Description: FREEtree, a tree-based method for high dimensional longitudinal data with 
    correlated features. FREEtree deals with longitudinal data by using a 
    piecewise random effect model. It also exploits the network structure 
    of the features, by first clustering them using Weighted Gene Coexpression 
    Network Analysis (WGCNA). It then conducts a screening step within each 
    cluster of features and a selecting step among the surviving features, 
    which provides a relatively unbiased way to do feature selection. By 
    using dominant principle components as regression variables at each 
    leaf and the original features as splitting variables at splitting nodes, 
    FREEtree maintains interpretability and improves computational efficiency.
